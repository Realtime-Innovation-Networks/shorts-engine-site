# RIN Shorts Engine Site

This repository hosts the static website for **RIN Shorts Engine**, a private tool created and used by a single developer to automate the posting of short-form video content to TikTok through the official TikTok APIs.

The site is required for TikTok Developer App review and provides the following pages:

- **Home (`index.html`)**: Basic description of the tool.
- **Privacy Policy (`privacy.html`)**: Explains how tokens and metadata are handled.
- **Terms of Service (`terms.html`)**: Outlines usage scope and compliance with TikTok’s guidelines.

## Purpose

- This website is **not** a consumer-facing app or service.
- It exists only to describe the tool during TikTok API approval.
- **RIN Shorts Engine** is strictly a personal automation tool; there are no external users.

## Structure

- `index.html` — Landing page with project overview and navigation links.
- `privacy.html` — Privacy Policy.
- `terms.html` — Terms of Service.
- `style.css` — Shared CSS stylesheet with responsive, light/dark mode styling.

## Hosting

This site can be deployed easily to any static hosting service (e.g. GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages).  
The only requirement is that the pages be accessible via HTTPS so they can be linked in the TikTok Developer Portal.
